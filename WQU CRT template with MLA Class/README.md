## Colaborative Review Task (CRT) template based on MLA class

The best way to use this tempalte is to download the entire folder in zip format and unzip it to your PC.<br>
Then you can use the template as a starting point for your work locally or use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com?r=049a7499&rm=d&rs=b) completely free for basic usage (for very long and complex documents, you might need to switch to the paid version, but for these works, the free version should be enough). <br>
The main source is in  [wqu.tex](wqu.tex), the references must go in [wqu.bib](wqu.bib), the [mla.cls](mla.cls) is the base class for the document and [WQU_Radial-Icon_FullColor_RGB.png](WQU_Radial-Icon_FullColor_RGB.png) is the logo for the first page. The `fig` folder is used to store the images for your project to keep things in order.<br>
A preview of the template is available as [mscfe_crt.pdf](mscfe_crt.pdf).
